Got it — that's definitely the root cause. Since your Git email doesn’t match a **verified email on your GitHub account**, your contributions won’t show up on the contribution graph, even though you're committing and pushing correctly.

---

### ✅ Here's How to Fix It:

#### 1. **Set the Correct Email**

Run this in your terminal (replace with your actual verified GitHub email):

```bash
git config --global user.email "your_verified_email@example.com"
```

If you want to apply it only to the current repo:

```bash
git config user.email "your_verified_email@example.com"
```

#### 2. **Fix Past Commits (Optional but Useful)**

If you want your previous commits to count in the contribution graph, you’ll need to **rewrite history** with the correct email. Here's how:

**⚠️ Warning**: This changes history — do it only if you're the only one working on the repo or you're okay with force pushing.

Run:

```bash
git rebase -i HEAD~10  # or however many commits you want to fix
```

In the interactive menu:

* Change `pick` to `edit` for each commit you want to fix.
* For each one, run:

  ```bash
  git commit --amend --author="Your Name <your_verified_email@example.com>"
  git rebase --continue
  ```

After fixing all commits, force push:

```bash
git push --force
```

#### 3. **Check Contribution Graph**

Give GitHub a few minutes — your green squares should appear after syncing.
