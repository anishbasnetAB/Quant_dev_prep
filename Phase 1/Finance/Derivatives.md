## 🧮 PART 5: Option Example – Call Option

### 📈 Example:

* Apple stock = \$100
* Call Option: Strike = \$100, Premium = \$5, Expiry = 1 month

### Outcome 1: Apple → \$120

* Exercise option: Buy at \$100, sell at \$120
* Profit = \$20 gain − \$5 premium = **\$15**

### Outcome 2: Apple → \$95

* Don’t exercise; let it expire
* Loss = **\$5 premium**

🔑 You paid \$5 not to buy the stock—but to **control the right** to buy it.

---

## 📉 PART 6: Option Example – Put Option

### 📉 Example:

* Tesla stock = \$200
* Put Option: Strike = \$200, Premium = \$7

### Outcome 1: Tesla → \$160

* Exercise option: Sell at \$200, buy at \$160
* Profit = \$40 − \$7 = **\$33**

### Outcome 2: Tesla → \$220

* Let it expire; lose the **\$7 premium**

| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------ |
| **Stock Price (S)**    | Higher price → Call ↑, Put ↓            |        |
| **Strike Price (K)**   | Closer to market = higher value         |        |
| **Time to Expiry (T)** | More time → Higher premium              |        |
| **Volatility (σ)**     | Higher risk → Higher premium            |        |
| **Interest Rates (r)** | Slightly affects call/put value         |        |
| **Dividends**          | Reduces call value, increases put value |        |

## 🧠 Final Concepts to Remember

* **You don’t get the stock for \$5**, you get the **right to buy it at \$100** for \$5 (premium).
* **Premium is like insurance**—you pay for potential protection or profit.
* **Option value is based on time, volatility, and the current stock price.**
* **Options give leverage**: small cost, large exposure.
* **Only exercise if it benefits you**—otherwise, let it expire.
