## 📌 SECTION 1: NumPy Arrays – Theory, Use, and Internal Design

---

### 🔷 What is a NumPy array?

A **NumPy array (`ndarray`)** is a grid of **homogeneous data (same dtype)** with:

* A fixed size
* Contiguous memory layout (like C arrays)
* Support for **vectorized operations** (e.g., `a + b`)

#### 🧠 Why use NumPy arrays?

| Feature             | Explanation                                                           |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Fast                | Built on C; operations are compiled, not interpreted                  |
| Memory-efficient    | Arrays are tightly packed — no overhead like Python lists             |
| Vectorized          | Loop-free operations                                                  |
| Essential for Quant | Enables fast math over large datasets — stock returns, matrices, etc. |

### 🔷 Creating Arrays – How and Why

```python
import numpy as np

a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
```

* **Homogeneous**: All elements are integers
* **Fixed-size**: Unlike Python lists, cannot grow dynamically
* **Vectorized**: Can apply math operations directly

#### ✅ Example: Daily price vector

```python
prices = np.array([100.5, 101.2, 102.3])  # dtype = float64
```

#### Creating with shape, filler, or randomness:

```python
np.zeros((2, 3))     # All 0s in 2x3 shape
np.ones((3, 3))      # All 1s
np.full((2, 2), 5)   # All 5s
np.eye(3)            # Identity matrix (used in portfolio math)
np.random.randn(3, 2) # Normal distribution
```

> 🎯 Use `np.eye` in portfolio optimization (e.g., regularization in inverse of covariance matrix).

---

### 🔷 Attributes and Shape

```python
a = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
print(a.shape)     # (2, 3)
print(a.ndim)      # 2 (matrix)
print(a.size)      # 6 elements
```

**Use case:** Shapes must match during dot products, reshaping, and broadcasting.

---

## 📌 SECTION 2: Indexing, Slicing, Reshaping — *Quant Examples Included*

---

### 🔷 Indexing

```python
a = np.array([[10, 20, 30], [40, 50, 60]])

a[0, 2]  # 30
a[1]     # [40, 50, 60]
```

* **a\[0,2]**: Element at row 0, column 2.
* **a\[1]**: Entire row 1.

---

### 🔷 Slicing

```python
a[:, 1]     # all rows, column 1 → [20, 50]
a[0:2, 1:]  # rows 0 and 1, columns 1 onwards → [[20, 30], [50, 60]]
```

🎯 Used in:

* Selecting specific asset columns
* Filtering date ranges in price matrices

---

### 🔷 Reshaping

```python
a = np.arange(6)         # [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
a.reshape(2, 3)          # [[0, 1, 2], [3, 4, 5]]
a.reshape(-1, 1)         # Column vector
```

* `-1` automatically computes size.
* Reshape to control **row/column form** for matrix math.

📌 In portfolio math, weights must be shape (N, 1) or (1, N) to match dot products.

---

## 📌 SECTION 3: Vectorized Arithmetic – Key to Quant Speed

---

### 🔷 Elementwise Ops

```python
a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
b = np.array([4, 5, 6])

print(a + b)     # [5 7 9]
print(a * b)     # [4 10 18]
```

* Elementwise means `a[0]+b[0], a[1]+b[1]` etc.
* No loops required — NumPy does it in C under the hood.

✅ Fast for:

* Return calculations
* Risk matrices
* Sharpe ratio computation

---

### 🔷 Aggregations

```python
a = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])

a.sum()        # 10
a.mean(axis=0) # Mean of each column → [2.0, 3.0]
a.std(axis=1)  # Row-wise std dev → [0.5, 0.5]
```

---

## 📌 SECTION 4: **Broadcasting – The Hidden Power of NumPy**

---

### 🔷 What Is Broadcasting?

> Broadcasting lets you perform arithmetic between arrays of **different shapes** without explicitly reshaping or duplicating data.

It avoids:

* Slow for-loops
* Manual expansion
* Excess memory copying

---

### 🔷 Broadcasting Rules

| Rule                                   | Explanation              |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Align shapes **right to left**         | (3, 1) and (1, 4) → OK   |
| A dimension is 1 → repeat              | (5, 1) + (1, 6) = (5, 6) |
| If mismatch and neither is 1 → ❌ Error |                          |

---

### 🔷 Examples: Shape Analysis

```python
A = np.array([[1, 2, 3],
              [4, 5, 6]])  # shape (2,3)
B = np.array([10, 20, 30])  # shape (3,)

# Broadcasting: B becomes (1,3), auto-replicated over rows
print(A + B)
# Output:
# [[11 22 33]
#  [14 25 36]]
```

---

### 🔷 Column-wise Broadcasting

```python
A = np.array([[1], [2], [3]])  # shape (3,1)
B = np.array([10, 20, 30])     # shape (3,) → (1,3)

# Result: shape (3,3)
C = A + B
```

#### 🔍 Real Application: Volatility Surface

Imagine 3 strike prices vs 3 time periods:

```python
strikes = np.array([[100], [110], [120]])     # (3,1)
times = np.array([30, 60, 90]) / 365          # (3,) → broadcasted
vol_surface = np.sqrt(strikes + times)        # (3,3) result
```

---

### 🔷 Higher Dimensional Broadcasting

```python
A = np.ones((3, 1, 4))
B = np.ones((1, 5, 1))

# Broadcasted shape → (3, 5, 4)
```

Use in:

* Options pricing tensor calculations
* Risk models over time and instruments

---

### ⚠️ Edge Case: Incompatible Shapes

```python
a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
b = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])

# a + b  → ❌ ValueError: shapes (3,) and (2,2) not aligned
```

Always **print shapes** when debugging:

```python
print(a.shape)
print(b.shape)
```

---

## 📌 SECTION 5: Broadcasting Use Cases in Quant Finance

---

### ✅ 5.1 Simulated Returns (1000 days, 3 assets)

```python
np.random.seed(42)
returns = np.random.normal(loc=0.001, scale=0.02, size=(1000, 3))  # (1000 days, 3 assets)
weights = np.array([0.5, 0.3, 0.2])  # (3,)

daily_portfolio_return = returns @ weights   # shape = (1000,)
```

---

### ✅ 5.2 Normalize Each Row (Subtract Mean)

```python
X = np.array([[1, 2, 3],
              [4, 5, 6]])

row_means = X.mean(axis=1, keepdims=True)  # shape (2,1)
normalized = X - row_means
```

---

## 📌 SECTION 6: Best Practices, Edge Tips

---

### 🔸 Always Use `keepdims=True` in stats ops for shape safety.

### 🔸 Use `.reshape(-1, 1)` to create column vectors for dot products.

### 🔸 Avoid `a += b` if b is being broadcast — may mutate memory unexpectedly.
